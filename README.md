-   Check for the LED in the ON state (not blinking)
-   Connect the USB device to the host.

<a name="Using the CE"></a>

## Using the CE

The Project can be created using any one of the following ways:

### Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; Follow the steps given here:
1. **Quick Panel** --> **New Application**

2. In the Project Creator Tool, choose a kit that is supported by the code example  **Project Creator** --> **Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

3. Click on the check box containing the example under **Select Application**

4. Click **Create**.

### Using the CLI

   1. Open the  Project Creator from the Windows Start menu

   2. You could also choose  *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/project-creator.exe*.

   3. Choose the required BSP, and click **Next**.

   3. Select the appropriate IDE from the **Target IDE** drop-down menu under the **Select Application**

   4. Click **Create**

   5. Export the application to the desired IDE. Refer to the ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide, "Using applications with third-party tools" chapter for details.
<a name="Setting up chip-tool"></a>

## Setting up chip-tool

Once the application is running, set up chip-tool on Raspberry Pi 4 to perform commissioning and cluster control.

-   Set up python controller.

           $ cd {path-to-connectedhomeip}
           $ ./scripts/examples/gn_build_example.sh examples/chip-tool out/debug

-   Execute the controller.

           $ ./out/debug/chip-tool

## Commissioning over Bluetooth&reg; LE

Run the built executable and pass it the discriminator and pairing code of the remote device, as well as the network credentials to use.

         $ ./out/debug/chip-tool pairing ble-wifi 1234 ${SSID} ${PASSWORD} 20202021 3840

         Parameters:
         1. Discriminator: 3840
         2. Setup-pin-code: 20202021
         3. Node ID: 1234 (you can assign any node id)
         4. SSID : Wi-Fi SSID
         5. PASSWORD : Wi-Fi Password

<a name="Notes"></a>

## Notes

Raspberry Pi 4 Bluetooth&reg; LE connection issues can be avoided by running the following commands. These power cycle the Bluetooth&reg; hardware and disable BR/EDR mode.

          $ sudo btmgmt -i hci0 power off
          $ sudo btmgmt -i hci0 bredr off
          $ sudo btmgmt -i hci0 power on

<a name="Cluster control"></a>

## Cluster control

-   After successful commissioning, use the Lock Unlock cluster command to toggle     device between Lock or Unlock states.

    `$ ./out/debug/chip-tool door-lock lock 1234 1`

    `$ ./out/debug/chip-tool door-lock unlock 1234 1`

-   Cluster Lock Unlock can also be done using the `USER_BTN1` button on the board.
    This button is configured with `APP_LOCK_BUTTON` in `include/AppConfig.h`.
    Press `USER_BTN1` on the board to toggle between lock and unlock states. The     Lock/Unlock status of the door lock can be observed with 'Red LED' on the board. This     LED is configured with `LOCK_STATE_LED` in `include/AppConfig.h`.

<a name="OTA Software Update"></a>

## OTA software update
-  Over The Air (OTA) support can be included in the Wi-Fi door lock application by following either of these routes:

### Using the Infineon OTA middleware library
The OTA library provides support for Over-The-Air update of the application code running on an Infineon device. The ModusToolbox OTA code examples import the ota-update library automatically. This application is built in ModusToolbox&trade; software, integrated with the OTA library.

For more information refer - [OTA_using_ModusToolbox] https://github.com/Infineon/ota-update

### Using MATTER (project-chip repository)

Matter provides a system for OTA to be run as a provider requestor.

<a name="PSoC&trade; 6 Deep Sleep"></a>

## PSoC&trade; 6 Deep Sleep

- PSoC&trade; 6 can put to Deep Sleep for longer period of time by suspending Network stack and enabling WLAN Offload features using [LPA](https://github.com/Infineon/lpa).

- Refer to LPA Quick Start Guide - [Code Snippets](https://infineon.github.io/lpa/lpa_api_reference_manual/html/group__lpautilities.html) for more information on APIs to be used.

- Network stack suspend/resume logic should be added after Wi-Fi Connection is successfully established. This can be done in `AppTask::Init` function after starting `DnssdServer`.

```
    if (event->InternetConnectivityChange.IPv4 == kConnectivity_Established ||
        event->InternetConnectivityChange.IPv6 == kConnectivity_Established)
    {
        chip::app::DnssdServer::Instance().StartServer();
        //Create new task which calls wait_net_suspend API implemented in LPA
    }
```

- Configure Various WLAN offloads using the ModusToolbox&trade; Device Configurator. Refer to LPA [Quick Start Guide](https://infineon.github.io/lpa/lpa_api_reference_manual/html/index.html#section_lpa_getting_started)
